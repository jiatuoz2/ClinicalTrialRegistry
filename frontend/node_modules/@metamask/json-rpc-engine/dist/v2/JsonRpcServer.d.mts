 * A JSON-RPC server that handles requests and notifications.

 * even if the underlying engine is only able to handle one or the other.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const server = new JsonRpcServer({
 *   engine,
 *   onError,
 * });
 *
 * const response = await server.handle(request);
 * if ('result' in response) {
 *   // Handle result
 * } else {
